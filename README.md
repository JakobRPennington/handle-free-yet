# HandleFreeYet

Twitter will soon be releasing handles of accounts that have been inactive for more than 6 months. HandleFreeYet lets you submit a handle and checks daily whether the handle is free yet. When the handle is made available, it sends out an email to let you know. Neat! üòÑ

## What are you doing with my email?

The ONLY time you will get emailed is when your Twitter handle becomes available. I don't want your email, and I certainly don't want to spam you, but I need some way to get in contact!

## Buy Me a Coffee

If you managed to get the handle you wanted, or you just like to support people making cool stuff, you can buy me a coffee! All coffees are much appreciated ‚ù§
